# About this project
This project is designed to teach people some cyber development skills.

You should go through each exercise and learn the concepts. Then use your research skills to program those concepts in C.

*Note*: This is a personal project and it's mainly for my own learning but it might as well be used to teach others as well.

*Note*: I programmed most of these examples using WSL and POSIX C. If there are any deviations from this, it will be documented in the exercises.

### Topics that I would like to cover:

1. Reverse shell
    - You will create a reverse shell using C.
2. Remote Access Tool
    - You will create a RAT that can perform simple tasks on a victim machine.
3. Encryption or Obfuscation
4. Custom network protocols
5. Kernel Driver Tool
5. More topics eventually



## How to practice

1. Go to the project you want to work on i.e. `reverse-shell`
2. Choose `linux` or `windows` (right now it's only linux)
3. Do each exercise
4. For coding exercise you will need to:
    - Read the instructions/hints in the comments
    - Complete the TODOs in `main.c` and `utils.c`
    - Compile using `make` and clean using `make clean`
    - Your outputs are in `output` folder
5. Try to look into documentation on how to best implement these tools. My implementation might not be the best since I'm just doing it for practice/learning.
