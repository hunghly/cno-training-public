# About this project
A list of tools to help with learn some cyber developer concepts.

Goals
1. Reverse shell
2. Remote Access Tool
3. Kernel Driver Tool
4. More?!?

## How to practice

1. Go to the project you want to work on i.e. `reverse-shell`
2. Choose `linux` or `windows` (right now it's only linux)
3. Do each exercise
4. For coding exercise you will need to:
    - Read the instructions/hints in the comments
    - Complete the TODOs in `main.c` and `utils.c`
    - Compile using `make` and clean using `make clean`
    - Your outputs are in `output` folder
5. Try to look into documentation on how to best implement these tools. My implementation might not be the best since I'm just doing it for practice/learning.
